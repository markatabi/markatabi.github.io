<h3>
	DETAIL</h3>
<p><i>The following is a detailed description of my career experience.</i></p>
<p><a name="ASU"></a>I have been in the graphics business since 1978, in the Boone area since 1981. As an undergraduate I worked on the advertising staff of <i>The Appalachian</i>, the student newspaper of <b>Appalachian State University</b>. Initially hired as a production staff member, I was promoted to Production Staff Manager.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><a name="PP"></a>In 1983 I was employed by a local print shop, <b>Precision Printing</b>. Hired to handle all graphics work (typesetting, design, layout, camera work, platemaking) for the business, I maintained all the prepress operations for more than 3 years before training an assistant in each of the tasks mentioned above. The shop&#39;s specialty was 2- and 3-color printing.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><a name="Alpine"></a>In 1987 I was hired by <b>Alpine Ski Center</b>, a ski equipment retailer, to manage the publications for its marketing department. The headquarters for the four-store company, located in Banner Elk, produced an annual magazine and four newspaper tabloids with editorial content, advertising (both in-house and vendor), and information directed to the Southern alpine skier. Primary responsibilities included copy writing and editing for the publications as well as production management. In the six-month position with this company I earned nine hours internship credit toward completing a bachelor&#39;s degree in English at Appalachian State University. (Alpine Ski Center had become a standing client of my graphics business.)</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><a name="Chetola"></a>In January 1988 I was recruited to establish and manage an in-house publications department for <b>Chetola Resort</b> at Blowing Rock. I set up the department to design and produce all the resort&#39;s printing needs including: writing and production of the resort&#39;s quarterly newsletter; all in-house forms, marketing materials, and signs; newspaper and magazine ads; rate sheets, flyers, one-, two-, and four-color brochures. I was responsible for obtaining quotes and ordering all printed material, a 1988 calendar year total of $42,700. For much of the printing I determined the resort&#39;s consumption and quantities ordered.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><a name="abi"></a>On December 1, 1988, I opened my own graphics and typesetting business under the name of <font face="Times,serif"><i>abi</i></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="-2">GRAPHICS</font> while I continued to work for the resort part time. By May 1989 I moved to Boone where I set up to run my business full time, leasing my own equipment and office space.</p>
<p>A large part of my work includes designing print ads, brochures, newsletters, and logos. I have had a good exposure to the high-end output side of DTP (desktop publishing) having worked closely with several service bureaus. I have been closely involved with some as they muddled through the setup process. At times, my work served as guinea pig jobs as I pushed my own software and their hardware to the graphic limits. I&#39;m very excited about what the DTP industry has opened up for the experienced designer as new developments in technology continue to unfold.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><a name="ECRS"></a>In 1994 the president of <b>ECR Software Corporation</b>, which had been a regular client of <font face="Times,serif"><i>abi</i></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="-2">GRAPHICS</font>, approached me to join the emerging company as the graphics designer and marketing assistant to the president. Since the company was relatively small, my first duties included handling technical support calls. With this on-the-job-training approach I was soon very familiar with the software products and began updating and rewriting the technical manuals as well as the marketing and distribution materials. After six months with the Company, I took on the role of Training Director for classes held across the country for the dealers and technicians who sold and supported our software installations. As my knowledge of the industry increased, I became involved in providing solutions for the software users through the design of custom applications for the existing software products. This experience laid a strong foundation for my role in the design of a completely new, groundbreaking Windows NT-based retail enterprise automation program: Catapult. The design team spent a year in preparation before the development team began the immense project. My role as designer peaked during the following two years as the function designs and Use Cases were translated into screen designs. Another role that developed out of my hands-on work with the software product is Solutions Consultant working directly with end users at retail sites.</p>
<p>Throughout my 12 years with ECR Software Corporation I have thoroughly enjoyed the variety of roles and the challenging tasks involved, which have included:</p>
