<p>I'm not posting My Journey With Cancer or anything like that, but some of you may be interested in how I got here and how I'm dealing with it.
  </p><p>
I first got a melanoma diagnosis in 2007 with a lesion on my abdomen that was removed and the surrounding tissue excised. I was told it was a shallow lesion. A few other concerning moles and spots were removed or frozen off. My skin was checked over the years with no other concerns.
  </p><p>
Late 2018 I noticed some increased fatigue and low-grade nausea, but I just attributed it to getting old and being sedentary. In January a lymph node in my neck swelled up, which I hadn't noticed until it was about the size of a small grape. I waited a few weeks before seeing my doctor who did some blood tests. I was treated for an infection, but instead of the lymph node shrinking, it was still growing.
  </p><p>
I got a C scan that found many of the lymph nodes in my abdomen swollen, several of which began to be visible at the skin surface. It was clear these pressing against my digestive track were the cause of the nausea and their growth was causing general pain and discomfort. The lymph node in my neck grew to the size of a walnut shell.
  </p><p>
I had a lymph node in my chest biopsied and the results came back that it is Stage 4 melanoma that had metastatized into my lymphatic system. I saw an oncologist who ordered a PET scan and MRI. These found diffuse metastatic melanoma in my thigh muscles, spine, and lungs; but so far not in any other organs nor my brain.
  </p><p>
Further testing of the biopsy revealed I have a BRAF mutation of the melanoma (more about that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)">here</a>), which about half the people with melanoma have. The good news about this particular mutation is that there are targeted treatments that directly block the growth of the cancer cells, and this mutation typically has a better response rate to treatment than other melanomas. The treatment is oral medication that I have started and all the visible swollen lymph nodes have since shrunk. How much the cancer has been slowed or stopped can only be determined with another PET scan, which the doctors plan to do in a couple of months. 
  </p><p>
The bad news is that the cancer cells will eventually figure out a way around the block and start growing again. Melanoma is one of the most agressive cancers there is. The next stage would be to start an immuno theraphy that jacks up my immune system to go after the cancer. Both of these approaches are different from traditional chemo and radiation therapies that kill off cell growth in the body, healthy cells along with the cancer, which result in side effects that take a heavy toll on the body (fatigue, illness, hair loss). Targeted and immuno therapies have potential side effects that can be serious as well, but those are more rare than common I'm told. 
  </p><p>
I'm having some mild side effects to the meds I'm taking - some days I feel fine, others not so much. There are patients who have been on these meds for many years; others, not long before another treatment is necessary. Everyone is different and the doctors can't predict how my treatment will progress. For now I am under the care of a team of doctors - here in Boone and at the Levine Cancer Center in Charlotte - who are providing me with cutting edge treatment. They have access to trial studies when all else fails. 
  </p><p>
  <b>Reality Check:</b> I know that I will die from this cancer (barring any sudden fatality). Exactly how or when, no one can know. It might be many years from now, or just months. There is no cure yet, and only a small percentage of patients are living with NED (no evidence of disease). I was already on a path of decluttering my life; now that is accelerated for Abby's sake as well as my own. I plan to take advantage of the good days as much as I can. I can't afford to quit my job (and its  health insurance plan), but I am hoping to experience as much of the beauty of life and this world as I can. I want to make more art. Meet more people. Go more places. See, hear, touch, and taste more. 
  </p><p>
I am fortunate to have my loving family going through this with me. If you know them, please give them your love and support as much as (or more than) you might give me.
